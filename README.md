IRCBot - Open Source Code for MaskBot IRC Bot
********************************************

Code for my local hosted bot on irc.esper.net.
Has a range of commands and programmable games and has handlers to manually manage chat input. Has support for permissions for root and admin only commands, as well as command aliases. Programmed in java. Inspired by other bots and had help from StromHurst parsing espernet messages.

In future, will be programmable for others to use as their own bot with their own set of commands. Currently just a local bot called MaskBot on espernet. You can find it at #StrangeCo if you're interested.

You may use code from this bot to create your own bots, as long as you give me credit if you copy the code.

Used libraries:````
• javax.json-1.0.4.jar (For JSON config files)````
• jsoup-1.8.1.jar (For webpage data extraction. Only requried for .dex command)
